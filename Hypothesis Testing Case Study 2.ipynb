    "R-squared and Adjusted R-squared:\n",

    "R-squared (R²) measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (customer satisfaction) that can be explained by the independent variables (Gender, Marital_Status, Age, Income, Hear_About). In your case, R² is 0.043, which is quite low.\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared (Adj. R²) adjusts R² for the number of predictors in the model. It's even lower at 0.010.\n",
    "Business Implication: This indicates that the independent variables in your model (Gender, Marital_Status, Age, Income, Hear_About) collectively explain only a small portion of the variance in customer satisfaction. In other words, these variables are not doing a good job of predicting customer satisfaction, and there are likely other unaccounted factors influencing satisfaction.\n",
    "F-statistic and Prob (F-statistic):\n",
    "\n",
    "The F-statistic tests the overall significance of your regression model. It checks whether your model as a whole is better at explaining the variance in the dependent variable than a model with no predictors.\n",
    "In your case, the F-statistic is 1.306, and the associated p-value (Prob (F-statistic)) is 0.219, which is relatively high.\n",
    "Business Implication: The F-statistic suggests that the overall model might not be statistically significant. The p-value being high implies that there is not strong evidence that your model is better than a null model with no predictors. This further supports the notion that the selected independent variables may not be very effective in explaining customer satisfaction.\n",
    "AIC and BIC:\n",
    "\n",
    "AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) are measures of the model's goodness of fit, but they also account for model complexity.\n",
    "Lower values of AIC and BIC indicate a better fit. In your case, AIC is 697.3, and BIC is 742.9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Implication: While these values provide a measure of model fit, they should be compared to alternative models to determine if this model is the best choice. It's important to consider the trade-off between model fit and model complexity.\n",
    "In summary, the regression analysis suggests that the selected independent variables (Gender, Marital_Status, Age, Income, Hear_About) have limited explanatory power for customer satisfaction (the dependent variable). The low R-squared values and the high p-value of the F-statistic indicate that there may be other unaccounted factors or variables that significantly influence customer satisfaction. The business implication is that there is a need to explore additional or different factors that affect customer satisfaction and consider refining the model with more relevant predictors."
